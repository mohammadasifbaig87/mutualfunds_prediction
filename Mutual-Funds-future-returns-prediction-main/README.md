# Mutual-Funds-future-returns-prediction
A Machine Learning project that predicts the upcoming next 3years and 5years average returns, using Linear Regression model. (Considered yearly data from 2015-2024)

About Files:

  1.Two Folders in the repository, one is .ipynb files and other is PDF files.
  2.Three Machine Learning models is used, among these three Linear Regression gave better accuracy than other two models.
